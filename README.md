✨ **Spells I cast and domain of expertise:** Lua, Roblox Studio, *FL Studio*, and caffeine overdose.  

🎩 **Mission:** To craft immersive Roblox games that hook players with **engaging gameplay**, **unexpected plot twists**, and worlds that feel alive.  

⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
- My code is 10% logic, 90% "I’m sure this’ll work. If it crashes, reload. If it still crashes, blame the gremlins in the RAM."
